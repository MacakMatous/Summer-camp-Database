# Summer-camp-Database
This is a semester project that I did as part of my studies at university. It was supposed to be something interesting and maybe even useful for all of us. I decided to design a database for a summer scout camp. I solved the problem of allergies, diets, and also a small ordering system for a local food truck style store. Overall, I learned a lot during this project. It could come in handy when starting out with database design.
